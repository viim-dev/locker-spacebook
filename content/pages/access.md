# Access Control and Permissions

In the ViiM.world, users possess the freedom to create and customize virtual objects and events that exist in a mixed-reality overlay of our physical world. An integral part of this creation process is the ability to define who can interact with these entities and in what capacity. The access control system of ViiM.world is designed to provide our users with the power to set permissions, giving them control over their creations.

## Access Control Lists (ACL)

Access Control Lists (ACL) play a vital role in managing user permissions within ViiM.world. They determine who can view, modify, or interact with the ViiM Objects and Events. Here is a breakdown of how ACLs operate:

- **Owner Access**: By default, the creator of a ViiM Object or Event (identified via their Locker ID) has full control over it. They can view, modify, interact, and define access for other users.
  
- **Public/Private Access**: The creator can choose to make their object or event public, allowing all ViiM.world users to view and interact with it based on defined permissions. Alternatively, they can keep it private, limiting access to specific users.
  
- **User-Specific Permissions**: The creator can grant specific permissions to individual users. For example, User A can be given view-only access, while User B might have permission to modify the object or trigger associated events.

## Future Developments in Access Control

As ViiM.world evolves, our access control system will also expand to meet the growing needs of our users. Here are a few potential future developments:

- **Group Permissions**: The ability to define permissions for user groups. For instance, a user could create a 'Friends' group and give them special access to certain ViiM Objects or Events.

- **Location-Based Access**: Permissions could be defined based on the geographical location of users. This feature would be particularly useful for creating location-specific experiences or challenges.

- **Timed Access**: Permissions that are valid only for a specific time frame. This could be useful for events or temporary installations within the ViiM.world.

Access control is a critical aspect of the ViiM.world platform, empowering users to control their virtual environment while ensuring the security and integrity of their creations.
