# User Registration

ViiM.world provides an intuitive and secure process for users to register and create their unique digital identity within our mixed reality platform. This digital identity is crucial as it enables users to create, manage, and interact with ViiM objects and events that exist within the digital overlay of the physical world.

## Registration Process

1. **Access Registration**: Users can initiate the registration process by visiting the ViiM.world platform. Users can register via their existing email address or through their Google account, providing them with flexibility and convenience.

2. **Provide Details**: During registration, users will be prompted to provide necessary information, including a secure password that adheres to our password policy to ensure the highest security level. If they choose to use a Google account, they will be redirected to Google's secure sign-in process.

3. **Locker ID Generation**: Upon successful registration, a unique "Locker" ID is generated for each user. This Locker serves as the user's personal repository for their ViiM objects and events.

## Digital Identity and Security

In a mixed reality platform like ViiM.world, maintaining a secure digital identity is paramount. The user's digital identity forms the basis of their interactions within the platform. This identity is directly tied to the user's Locker and the objects and events that they create.

We employ advanced security measures during the registration process to protect our users. The communication between the client and the server during the registration process is encrypted to prevent any unauthorized access to personal information. Furthermore, passwords are stored securely using modern cryptographic methods.

## Locker ID

The Locker ID is a unique identifier assigned to each user upon registration. This Locker ID links the user with their creations - the ViiM objects and events they bring to life. It serves as a personal storage for these entities, ensuring that users have a secure and private space within the platform. The Locker system promotes user autonomy, allowing individuals to manage their creations and dictate the levels of interaction they wish to have within the ViiM.world.
